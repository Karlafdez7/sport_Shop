# Sport Shop

My first website with **HTML and SASS**.

## Tools used:

- ZEPLIN 🔎
- VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VSC) 🗄️
- HTML 📌
- CSS 🕹️
- GIT / GITHUB 📂
- SASS / SCSS 🔗
- GULP 🖌️

### I leave you some images of the project


Fully responsive website.

### To be able to navigate through this repository you can follow these steps:

1. In the SRC/ folder you will find the files that I have created in HTML and SCSS, but also the folder of fonts and images.
2. There are also the folders public/ and docs/, these are created automatically when starting the project. Their functionality is super important when it comes to being able to visualize what is being created.
<em> I'm sure you will want to know a little more about this project, so feel free to contact me for any questions or advice to improve my code!

#### Thank you for visiting me 🔎
