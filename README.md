# Sport Shop

My first website with **HTML and SASS**.

## Tools used:

- ZEPLIN 🔎
- VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VSC) 🗄️
- HTML 📌
- CSS 🕹️
- GIT / GITHUB 📂
- SASS / SCSS 🔗
- GULP 🖌️

## Project request:
The exercise consists of developing a web page according to a provided design. Several points had to be addressed:

Use of Sass.
Use of flexbox and CSS Grid.
Use of media queries.
As an extra: solving some interactions using transitions.
For the layout: Design created in Zeplin.

**Details:**

1. The hamburger button (in the top left corner) should be fixed at the top of the screen and should not disappear when scrolling. The hamburger icon should be a link to the Adalab page. This hamburger menu does not display any submenus.

2. First module (hero - Up to 50% off): it should be laid out with Flexbox and should occupy the full height of the browser window.

3. Second module (Connect with you): it can be laid out using any CSS properties desired.

4. Third module (New year, new moves): the 3 items in the list should be laid out with CSS Grid in all screen sizes where it is needed.

5. Fourth module (footer): it should be laid out using flexbox. All the texts in the "ZAPATILLAS" column and all the texts in the "TWITTER" column should be links to the Adalab page.

**Interaction:**

There are several user interactions that we need to address:

1. The arrow button in the first module (the hero) should link to the "New Year, New Moves" section.

2. The arrow button located above the footer should link to the top of the page.

3. All footer links should go to https://adalab.es.
4. BONUS: Create a small animation on the hero and footer buttons (to investigate animation properties).

### To be able to navigate through this repository you can follow these steps:

1. In the SRC/ folder you will find the files that I have created in HTML and SCSS, but also the folder of fonts and images.
2. There are also the folders public/ and docs/, these are created automatically when starting the project. Their functionality is super important when it comes to being able to visualize what is being created.
<em> I'm sure you will want to know a little more about this project, so feel free to contact me for any questions or advice to improve my code!
